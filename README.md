# Cast â€“ [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) Workflow

This workflow helps to prepare your environment for screen share and then helps to revert changes.

On start workflow will:
* disable notifications
* hide desktop icons
* turn on Dock auto-hide
* turn on menu bar auto-hide
* open Keycastr app
* close Twitterrific, Telegram
* restart Finder

On stop workflow will:
* enable notifications
* show desktop icons
* turn off Dock auto-hide
* turn off menu bar auto-hide
* close Keycastr app
* open Twitterrific, Telegram
* restart Finder

Modify workflow to fit your needs.

NOTE: menu bar autohide not working properly, you might need to re-enable it manually: System Preferences / General / Automatically hide and show the menu bar.
